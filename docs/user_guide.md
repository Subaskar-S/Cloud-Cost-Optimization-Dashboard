3. Review total spending vs. budget
4. Identify top cost drivers in pie chart
5. Check daily trends for anomalies

**Key Questions**:
- Are we on track with our monthly budget?
- Which services are driving the highest costs?
- Are there any unusual spending spikes?

### 2. Service Optimization Analysis
**Steps**:
1. Open Service Analysis Dashboard
2. Filter by specific service (e.g., EC2)
3. Review cost trends over time
4. Analyze regional distribution
5. Identify optimization opportunities

**Key Questions**:
- Which services have the highest growth rates?

- Which resources might be over-provisioned?

### 3. Budget Planning
**Steps**:
1. Use Executive Dashboard for historical trends
2. Analyze seasonal patterns
3. Project future costs based on trends
4. Set appropriate budget thresholds

**Key Questions**:
- What are our historical spending patterns?
- How do costs vary by season or business cycle?
- What should our budget be for next quarter?

### 4. Cost Anomaly Investigation
**Steps**:
1. Identify spikes in daily cost trends
2. Use Service Analysis to drill down
3. Filter by date range around the anomaly
4. Identify the specific service/region causing the spike

**Key Questions**:
- When did the cost spike occur?
- Which service caused the increase?
- Is this a one-time event or ongoing trend?
